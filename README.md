# ATM Cash Predictor
> Creation Date: June, 2021
## Description
ATM should not be filled with large amount of cash which may bring low transport/logistic cost
but high freezing and high insurance costs. The purpose of the project entitled as “ATM Cash
Predictor” is to predict the correct amount of cash that will filled on the next day in ATM so that
Banks can earn more by not storing extra money on ATMs. To accomplish our goal we are using
some very famous Machine Learning Techniques called as Linear Regression and it’s an advance
version XGB Boost to train and test our models.
